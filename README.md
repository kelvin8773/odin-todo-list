# Odin Todo List App

> An Odin Project to learn JavaScript key concepts by utilizing only plain JavaScript (without any JS framework).

In this todo app, we tried to demonstrate some advance programming concepts, such as:

* OOP Principles (Object Oriented Programming).
  * Single Responsibility.
  * Loose Coupling (Try to implement Later).

* Objects.
* Factory Functions.
* Module Pattern.
* Module-View-Controller(MVC) architectural pattern.

We also tried to utilize various modern technologies to help imitating real world development experiences from this project, you are welcome to replicate, distribute and re-generate our project for your personal learning purpose.
